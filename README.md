Abstract

Diabetes is a serious chronic condition that poses a great threat to human health. Diabetes is characterized by a high blood glucose level caused by defective insulin secretion or impaired biological effects, or both. Diabetes can result in chronic damage and dysfunction of various tissues, including the eyes, kidneys, heart, blood vessels, and nerves. Therefore, the ability to diagnose and analyze diabetes rapidly and accurately is a topic worth exploring. The earlier we can detect and manage it, the better. Using their physical examination data, machine learning can help people to make a preliminary diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, and it can also be a helpful reference for doctors. The aim of this study is to predict diabetes accurately using a variety of machine learning techniques, including Support Vector Machines (SVM), Decision Trees (DT), Logistic Regression, AdaBoost, K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), and Gradient Boosting Classifiers.

Conclusion 

In this project several models were developed using different Machine learning techniques such as Support Vector Machine, Random Forest, Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbor, Ada Boost and Gradient Boosting Classifier.

The evaluation of our models was based on Recall metric.

and used our best model 

Communication

In addition, we made a dashboard to show the result of the preferred predictive model.
